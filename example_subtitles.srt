00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Welcome to KokoroDoki's new SRT subtitle feature!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,500
This powerful enhancement allows you to generate
perfectly timed audio from subtitle files.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Each subtitle entry is processed individually
and placed at its exact timestamp.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You can now create synchronized voiceovers
for videos, presentations, and more.

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,000
The generated audio maintains perfect timing
with your original subtitles.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,500
This opens up new possibilities for
content creation and accessibility.

7
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Try it out with your own SRT files
and experience the synchronization!

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Thank you for using KokoroDoki!
